**GOAL OF PROJECT:**

Increase engagement in Krause House (KH) and grow a guild of KH Agents to help onboard (1) existing DAO members to projects and (2) the general public interested in joining KH.

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

We are looking to update our KH onboarding approach based on our lessons learned from S1.

Most people refer to “onboarding” as a mechanism for integrating new members into an organization. We want to take this a step further and evolve this into the following:

1.  a recursive matchmaking system that allows for better facilitation of member skills & available projects.
    
2.  a system driven by Agents that will go beyond an initial touchpoint with any given member. We will have Agents assigned to cohorts of KH members and a CRM to track member progress for follow ups.
    

**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**

In pro sports and in the NBA, “Agents” are individuals who look out for their players best interests and look to get the signed to teams where they can perform best.

The following are a collection of responsibilities owned by the Agents.

-   Group Onboarding via Draft Classes - host a Draft Class 2 x week to introduce the overall KH vision and pathways to contribution via verbal communication.
-   Manage the #introduce-yourself channel with 24/7 attention & tag relevant project leads to the intros to build momentum early
-   Take 1on1s (15-30 min) calls with members looking for additional context and support

**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**

We used the data we had from the first two seasons as our reference point when deciding what success would look like moving forward.

_Definition of a Contributor:_

**Contributor = someone who has contributed for over a month or has earned 100+ $KRAUSE or $100 USDC from working on a project**

_Definition of Success:_

Average 40 new draft class attendees each week over a 2 month period

10% of draft class attendees become a Contributor over 2 month period

**FUNDING DETAILS:**

Compensation exists in the form of a monthly stream for:

-   5000 USDC
-   3000 $KRAUSE

This stream will run twice, for January and February.

These will be distributed end of each month based on people’s Points in the Onboarding [Scoreboard](https://www.notion.so/Onboarding-via-Agent-Model-352763af8d6446dbaae9f1abbf6e9cdf) and will Mario Lopes #2725, Dogstoevsky#0585, Magnus#3558.

NOTE: Mario will be ineligible to receive any project funds.

-   **FIXED:** Each Agent who has 5 hours of one-on-one call time **available** each week will get 10 $KRAUSE week.
-   **VARIABLE:** Commissions of 50 $KRAUSE are available for any Agent that converts a DAO member into a Contributor (see definition [here](https://www.notion.so/Requesting-5000-USDC-and-3000-KRAUSE-per-month-to-run-an-Onboarding-Project-via-an-Agent-Model-2cf52148ccc6441e9f2f8c7dc805eb64)) as tracked in the [Agent CRM](https://www.notion.so/Agent-s-CRM-bb68f4e9e8ac41aab0385006045eb2ba).
    -   Paid out at end of February
    -   If the 3000 $KRAUSE is fully paid out because we convert 60 members into Contributors, we will pay out the remaining commissions in USDC at a rate of 100 USDC for every converted Contributor

**TEAM:**
