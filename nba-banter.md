**Background & Summary**

We are requesting $300 USDC for a one-month trial to increase engagement and provide a regular source of activity in the #nba-banter channel. Currently, it is a general NBA-talk channel that generally has 0-10 messages every day. This trial will see if we can increase this – we want #nba-banter to be the go-to place people go to when discussing NBA related matters. Building a sense of belonging to Krause House will have long-term benefits for the DAO.

**Project specific details**

For 6 days of the week, either @views or @g0dex will be the content provider toward #nba-banter. This can be in the form of Streamable highlights, tweets, or any other relevant online content. The minimum for every day is 3 pieces of content to provide by either @views or @g0dex.

One day of the week will be the “rest” day, where there is no content provided by either @views or @g0dex. This is further discussed in the section below.

**Defining success**

We want #nba-banter to be the default place people go to while watching games, or even for general NBA content. We don’t have a hard metric of # of messages in the #nba-banter channel every day (can be easily gamed). Instead, we view success in terms of people taking initiative to post by themselves – not as reactions to content posted by @views or @g0dex. Maybe people will even start posting highlights / other content regularly themselves!

However, one way to measure success is for a light A/B test during the month trial. So, for 6 days of the week content will be provided, while there is 1 “rest” day. After the trial is up, we will tally up engagement activity for every day of the month and see if there are significant differences.

**After the trial**

After 1 month, how do we keep #nba-banter engaging? Perhaps it is to have a couple people on a workstream to engage with others. Another, more ideal case would be for organic activity unrelated to any workstream.

**Funding details:**

Compensation will be split evenly between @views and @g0dex.
