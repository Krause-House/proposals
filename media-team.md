## KEY PRIORITIES

### PRIORITY #1: SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT

  
Create consistent messaging plan to drive excitement, awareness, and promote Krause House by leveraging different social media platforms. Focus channels will be Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and Website content support.

## PRIORITY #2: “TRADITIONAL” MEDIA OUTREACH

  

Krause House’s greatest assets are Jerrys. They are a global team that shares the WAGBAT mission. By providing Jerrys with the information needed to speak clearly and accurately about the organization and its goals, they can confidently spread the word to mainstream media, bloggers, influencers, podcasters, and anyone else with an audience. Through the development and maintenance of a Media Outreach Toolkit, which includes vetted and approved messaging, shareable assets, and unified media lists, we can keep all keep the story straight, sharing the same rallying cry across all media, while minimizing the opportunities for potential detractors to take potshots and to create a negative narrative.

  

### KEY DELIVERABLES

-   Draft the key messaging points that all members of Krause House can confidently use when speaking about the organization and its goals to the media (or in any public forum).
    
-   Develop master list for media contacts, breaking out relevant verticals and identifying editors/writers that may be interested. This list will be open for all Jerrys to contribute to
    
-   Develop Basic Media Toolkit ready to be shared with Jerrys
    
-   Begin Media outreach (both Media team and all Jerrys)
    

  

### IMPRESSIONS/GOALS

-   Secure a minimum of 6 media stories reaching an audience of 300,000 potential Jerrys
    

## PRIORITY #3: PODCAST STRATEGY

  

The Krause Community offers an expansive pool of content creators specifically in the podcasting field. As of the moment, the DAO has 2 podcasts – Jerry’s Digest and the Krause House podcast. Both podcasts cover a variety of conversational topics that cater to different audiences. Furthermore, the DAO has members with their own podcasts willing to affiliate with the Krause House branding.

  

There is a good abundance of podcast content available for internal and external consumption. While the DAO benefits from this abundance, the signal to noise ratio becomes skewed towards noise. The goal of the podcast strategy team is to centralize the podcasts under Krause House DAO. This will be done through a series of rebranding and marketing efforts. By the end of the season, hopefully the team would’ve built the foundations for the KH podcast to rival the likes of The First Mint, Own the Moment, and other big names in the basketball-crypto intersection.

  

### KEY DELIVERABLES

-   Develop overall podcast strategy, identifying main podcast to represent Krause House DAO and determine the content, scope, and mission
    
-   Identify roles for other podcasts, including owned and affiliate
    

-   Focus on marketing the main Krause House podcast as the central podcast for the entire DAO
    
-   Explore revenue generation model utilizing podcast ad network
    
-   Rebrand all other podcasts not deemed as the main podcast
    

  

### IMPRESSIONS/GOALS

-   Increase Unique Downloads +300%
    
-   Increase Subscribers +200%
