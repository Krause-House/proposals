# Krause House DAO Proposals
Proposals for Krause House DAO governance. Votes will occur on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth). Please sign up for alerts within Snapshot.

## Proposal Template
**Summary**
In a few sentences, outline what you're proposing. Why you're proposing it & what you want from the DAO to make that happen.

**Why?**
Why are you doing this? Ideally, you've already addressed the "what" in the summary section above.

**Details**
What are the details of what you're proposing?

**The Ask**
What are you asking for? It's often compensation, but this can also be permission to do something. What do you need from the DAO?

**Defining Success**
Fast forward to a time when this proposal is completed & you / the team have accomplished the goal. How can we objectively know that this was successful? What data can we look at? What questions can we survey our DAO to see if the collective wisdom agrees that you've acheived your goal.

This can be hard, please take a look at some existing proposals ([1](https://github.com/Krause-House/proposals/blob/main/stewardship-team-12042021.md)) to get a sense of good questions to ask.
