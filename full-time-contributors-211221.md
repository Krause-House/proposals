# Fund Initial Full-Time Team


## Goal

We believe that we need a handful of people to make a full-time commitment to Krause House to rapidly achieve our mission. This was outlined in the original Mirror post & has been strongly advised to us by advisors + peers from popular DAOs. The intention is to ensure we have a core group of contributors with high context, talent, & responsibility for the success of Krause House. A core function of these full-time contributors will be to spin up & scale fundamental systems within Krause House with the intention of establishing long-term decentralized systems. Any full time contributor is not only beholden to their fellow full-time contributors, but the broader community at any time as well.


## Proposal

Set aside a monthly budget of $42,501 USDC + 17,500 $KRAUSE to fund an initial set of full-time contributors. Budgets and responsibilities for each contributor are outlined below, and will be paid monthly, starting immediately after proposal passing. Contributors can be fired at any point by the DAO through proposal, at which point future payments will cease.

Members of this team must retain 100% of their existing $KRAUSE balances for 2 years or until no longer being compensated as a full-time contributor.

**Monthly**

| **Name**     | **Style**        | **$USDC**  | **$KRAUSE** |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Commodore    | Fixed            | 16,667     | 0           |
| Flex Chapman | Fixed            | 16,667     | 0           |
| Mario Lopes  | Fixed            | 9,167      | 7,500       |
| Eli          | Hybrid / Dynamic | 0          | 10,000      |
| **Total**    |                  | **42,501** | **17,500**  |


## Why?

Krause House is scaling rapidly. Bounties & project compensation works well for certain types of work, but does not fit as well with things like operations or emergent opportunities / problems. Additionally, managing bounties and less active contributors is a significant resource spend. Having a set of full-time contributors insures the DAO against stagnation, and allows for a much richer level of commitment and context. Additionally, now that the treasury has a material amount of funds, continuity and stability over a longer time horizon is an important component of our ability to achieve our mission. We’ve consulted with our most trusted advisors & the group is unanimous in wanting a core full-time team pursuing the mission of Krause House.


## Why this team?

This list of contributors consists of X highly active contributors, 2 of which (Flex Chapman and Commodore) summoned the DAO. The 2 others (Mario Lopes and eli\_) began contributing to Krause House in July without pay and have taken it upon themselves to build and maintain core systems of onboarding and governance design. Throughout this time, this team participated in Seed Club and led the launch of Krause House’s crowdfund. These Jerry’s have defined and demonstrated consistent alignment with Krause House’s core values.


## How long?

We propose 4 months (effectively 2 seasons) to give us enough time to deliver against large milestones and also some stability with our work lives. We think it’s important for the community to have the option to cancel this arrangement quickly in the event it’s not working for Krause House. The community at any time can issue a proposal to remove one or all from the team. Assuming this arrangement is working well for the community, the intention will be to renew this arrangement.


## Compensation Structures

Each full-time contributor can decide between 2 compensation structures:

**Fixed**

Paid at an agreed upon salary amount in a stablecoin. The salary amount will be generally market rate. The full-time contributor cannot earn additional compensation by participating in projects within Krause House.

**Hybrid / Dynamic**

A base salary (50% of market) would be paid in a stablecoin. The full-time contributor would be able to participate in compensation within other projects that are approved by the community via Snapshot.


## Additional Details

Each of these contributors is required to hold their entire existing $KRAUSE balance in order to receive payment. Payments will be made monthly. In order to be eligible for the payment, the recipient's wallet address must still be holding the required amount of tokens to meet the obligation of 100% existing $KRAUSE tokens are being held. To be specific, “existing $KRAUSE” is defined as the quantity the team member received from the KH Community Airdrop allocation. To be extra clear, if the team member is earning $KRAUSE as part of their monthly compensation — those tokens_are not_ subjected to being locked. In the event a team member is removed from the team, their tokens are fully unlocked effective immediately.

This compensation structure is meant to be an experiment that we’ll continue to assess & improve over time.

This team will hold a monthly review with the Stewardship Team to make sure the workflows are being successfully delivered against.




## Systems

Below, we’ll outline our current best understanding of the systems we’ll be spinning up & operating during this time period. Over time, we’ll continue to modify these systems & the ways to track success for each. In the event the community has any issue with how the systems are being managed or tracked, the community can bring forth a proposal to remove the member from responsibility of the system and/or reducing their compensation.
