# Proposal for Stewardship Team


## Introduction

This proposal recommends the implementation of a Stewardship Team (ST). The Stewardship Team will consist of 8 high-context members who will provide leadership and direction to the DAO, establish priorities, and help manage proposals and expensive projects on behalf of all members. The ST will be able to solve key problems within Krause House such as developing a clear roadmap or DAO-wide understanding of what projects are most urgent. The ST will also be a robust team that can protect against potential future issues like hostile whale takeovers or Sybil attacks. This team would be compensated on a biweekly basis (every 2 weeks) and members could be elected or removed based on community voting.


## Why?

Krause House DAO could greatly benefit from a strong sense of direction. The vast majority of DAO members do not have a clear idea of the following:

- Short-term objectives or goals (beyond the less actionable ones of_buying a team_which is typically understood as_building treasury_ and _building community_)
- Priorities for Season 2 and beyond, including the most important initiatives
- Currently operating projects and where projects can collaborate

This lack of awareness creates highly siloed projects and a huge barrier to new contributors who don’t know what they should work on.

As proposals begin coming in for Season #2, Krause House DAO also needs a team of people who can negotiate with project leads, monitor expensive initiatives closely, and keep others up to date on treasury information. This team will also serve the DAO and protect against a variety of malicious proposals.


## Responsibilities of Stewardship Team

The Stewardship Team (ST) will be responsible for several key things, including the tasks currently done by the_Teams Team_and_Proposal Team_.


### Facilitate DAO-wide Clarity and Focus

The ST will host a meeting at least once a week (but up to as many times as is valuable) to discuss DAO issues, governance, compensation, treasury, ongoing projects, priorities, roadmap, goals/objectives and any other important matters. This will be a time for new people to join in and get scope on the DAO’s operations, and for existing members to tune in to hear the latest weekly developments.

The ST will also regularly update asynchronous materials that facilitate clarity such as Notion documentation and the website.


### Manage Proposals and the Treasury

The ST will review proposals for projects and discuss compensation, collaborations, expectations, and timelines with project leads. Proposals will be moved to Snapshot for a community vote once the project’s scope and compensation are clearly aligned with the DAO’s priorities. The ST will monitor expensive projects after they have received funding and hold the projects accountable to ensure that the DAO gets as much value out of its treasury as possible.

The ST will also submit requests for new projects/proposals to facilitate an easy way for contributors to become Project Leads.


### Administration

This includes controlling permissions for DAO members to Discord, Twitter, Notion and the multisig.

These administrative duties will also include managing a central repository (Notion) for text files, spreadsheets, brand assets and other relevant working documents.


## Compensation

The Stewardship Team will be streamed 400 $KRAUSE every two weeks. They will then be able to distribute this compensation amongst themselves based on what is fair. This compensation can be modified based on whether the DAO feels as though the value provided by the Stewardship Team is worth the $KRAUSE. A community proposal can be submitted to reduce, increase, or terminate the funding stream.


## Stewardship Team Nominees for Season 2

The following high-context and experienced members are being nominated for positions on the Stewardship Team for Season 2:

- commodore#0145
- flexchapman#5934
- GladRobot#6845
- Lewwwk#4227
- Magnus#3558
- Dogstoevsky#0585
- eli\_#0534
- Mario Lopes#2725


## Defining Success

This team’s objective is relatively ambiguous, therefore we’d like to pre-define a series of ways to determine if this team is operating successfully.

- Has the ST hosted consistent weekly meetings?
- Have the weekly ST meetings been well run, public (to ticket holders), & helpful?
- Has the ST helped people turn general ideas into specific actionable proposals?
- Has the ST successfully vetted proposals? Helping good ideas turn into proposals and giving constructive feedback on ideas potentially harmful to the DAO?
- Has the ST remained engaged with project leaders offering support as they need?
- Has the ST remained contextually aware of the large initiatives the DAO is pursuing to provide maximum context for decision making?
- Has the ST operated in alignment with the mission, vision, and values of our DAO?
